## Key Features

  Powered by Firebase, multiple users can build and edit schedules together with live updatesâ€”no refresh needed.

- **Automatic Clash Detection**  
  Instantly highlights scheduling conflicts. Prevents faculty or student groups from being scheduled in overlapping time slots.

  Tracks weekly teaching loads and displays warnings if a faculty member exceeds their configured limit.
